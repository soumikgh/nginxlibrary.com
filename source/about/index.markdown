####About the site

This site aims to be a repository of Nginx-related articles intended
to help users set up and configure Nginx on their server. This
site contains both basic articles for setting up and configuring Nginx as well
as advanced tutorials concerned with tweaking and getting the most out of your
Nginx installation.

####About the author

{% img left http://techtitbits.com/personal/images/avatar.jpg Ellimist %}
I'm Soumik Ghosh, a 20 year old student from Kolkata, India. I'm better known as Ellimist in the online communities I participate in. I started writing about Nginx on my [personal blog][1], (which, sadly, isn't updated anymore) before I branched off to create this site. Comments and/or questions are welcome.

####About Nginx

Nginx is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy,
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. [Igor Sysoev][2] started development of
Nginx in 2002, with the first public release in 2004. Nginx now hosts nearly
[12.18% (22.2M)][3] of all domains worldwide.

Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple
configuration, and low resource consumption.
