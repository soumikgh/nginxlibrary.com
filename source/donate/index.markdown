If you find the articles on this site useful, please consider making a donation. I'm saving up for my Masters degree and any donation, even a small amount, is highly appreciated. 
Donations encourage me to write more articles and reaffirms my belief in the fact that what I write is actually useful for some people.

Donations are accepted via Moneybookers(Skrill) or PayPal. Moneybookers is preferred since the fees are less and the forex rates are reasonable when compared to PayPal. However, if you are from the U.S., PayPal is probably your only option.

Please enter the amount and click on the image below to make a donation via MoneyBookers.
